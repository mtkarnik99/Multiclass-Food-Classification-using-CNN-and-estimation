# Multiclass-Food-Classification-using-CNN-and-estimation

ðŸ“˜ Project Title
Multiclass Classification using Keras and TensorFlow on Food-101 Dataset

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Downloads and extracts the Food-101 dataset.

Understands and visualizes the dataset's structure.

Splits data into training and test sets using train.txt and test.txt.

Creates a mini subset (3 classes) for quick experimentation.

Fine-tunes a pretrained InceptionV3 model on the dataset.

Plots model accuracy and loss curves.

Makes predictions on new images from the internet.

Fetches nutritional estimates (calories, fat, protein, etc.) for predicted foods using the CalorieNinjas API.

Scales up to 11 food classes for more complex training.

Includes model explainability tools.

Summarizes experiments, results, and provides feedback.
